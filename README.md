# Work-Day-Scheduler

Given some starter code for styling, I had to complete a Work Day Planner with accurate date and time. 
Designed for a "9 to 5" schedule, you must be able to enter text for appointments/events, and save it to local storage.
Using moment.js. the current date must be displayed at the top of the page. Finally, the current hour at the user's location 
must be linked to the hour by hour scheduler - to reflect past, present and future.
